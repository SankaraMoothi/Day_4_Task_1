a.var obj1={name:"person 1",age:5};
b.var obj2={age:5,name="person 1"};
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Actually we compare two different array or object with the help of a Equality operator "==",
*If we just type like obj1==obj2; its shows an false, 
*Because its order is different in this case, 
*so want to write an simple code and also in effecent way let try.....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we can solve it simply with an sample program;
--------------------------------------
var obj1 = {"name":"person 1","age":"5"};
var obj2 = {"age":"5","name":"person 1"};

var flag=true;

//first we want check that the both object has same length ;

if(Object.keys(obj1).length==Object.keys(obj2).length){

//here we using for in looping ðŸ”ƒ menthod to check both object key are match or not

    for(key in obj1) { 
//here we using condition operater to check that the key really match in two object; 
        if(obj1[key] == obj2[key]) {
            continue;
        }
        else {
            flag=false;
            break;
        }
    }
}
else {
    flag=false;
}
console.log("is object equal"+flag);

// it is most simple and basic way to find 
// there are many method are there to find it like
//    .isEqual();
// its also online code .....but in above code we can learn the  logic
